Be6 9. c3 Bc5 {Nothing up to here can be considered a huge surprise. Hikaru has
only been playing e4 with White, and Caruana repeated the same Bc5 Open Spanish
that he recently chose against MVL.} 10. Nbd2 O-O 11. Bc2 Nxf2 12. Rxf2 Bxf2+
13. Kxf2 f6 14. Nf1 fxe5 15. Kg1 {All of this is well known theory, but I think
Caruana fell into the same practical trap that Firouzja did against Nepo. I'm
quite confident Black's position is objectively fine here, but in practice, it
feels so much easier to play the White side.} 15... Qd6 (15... Qd7 {This was
Caruana's choice against Maxime in the aforementioned game. He certainly
equalized, but still went on to lose.}) 16. Be3 Bf5 17. Bb3 Rad8 18. Qe1 Na5 19.
Qf2 Nb7 {Both sides were still playing very fast.} 20. Re1 c5 21. Ng3 (21. Bg5
$5 {This was an interesting option, but my suspicion is that Black's position is
better than the computer suggests. After} 21... c4 $1 (21... Rde8 $2 22. Rxe5 $1
Rxe5 23. Bf4 $18) 22. Bxd8 cxb3 23. Bh4 bxa2 24. Ra1 Bb1 {I have a lot of
trouble evaluating the position, and once I let the computer run here, it became
less and less optimistic for White's chances. I think Hikaru was right to avoid
it.}) 21... Bd3 22. Qd2 c4 $2 {In my opinion, this is the move that lost Caruana
the game. The position is incredibly hard to understand, but I think the main
point is that Black will not be able to maintain his pawn on e5. It will
inevitably have to move to e4. When this happens, Black will really regret
having pushed c5-c4 because he loses any hope of fighting for the dark squares,
plus the light squared bishop can end up stuck on d3 and unable to fight on
other relevant parts of the board. White is only a bit better still, but Black's
position feels nearly impossible to play.} (22... e4 $1 {This should be
preferred. The position is messy and balanced. I would prefer the White side,
but the machine insists upon total equality.}) 23. Bd1 $1 {White does not
exchange the bishops. He has already seen that d3 will become a piece of dead
wood.} 23... Rd7 24. Bf2 Rdf7 25. Nh1 $1 {An excellent decision from Hikaru. The
move is not at all subtle, White wants to take on e5, or to play Bg3 next. Black
clearly will have to move the e-pawn.} 25... e4 26. Nd4 {This is exactly the
kind of position that I think is a practical nightmare for Black. Long term, he
will face huge issues as his pawns are blockaded in the center, and White will
eventually take them by having a larger total number of pieces on the board.
Black's compensation is that one of his pieces is bigger than White's, but the
main power of a larger piece over a smaller piece, such as a rook over a bishop,
is being able to attack multiple targets at once. And what do we have here $2
Black's rooks are both clearly on their best squares already. In fact, all of
his pieces look nice and active. But what is there to target $2 White has no
weaknesses. Slowly but surely, he will activate his pieces and organize them to
attack the pawns. Caruana surely could have defended better from here, but in
human terms, I think the game is already more or less lost, even though the
machine gives White only a 0.5 advantage or so. I think his big mistake was c4.}
26... Qg6 27. h4 Nc5 (27... h5 $1 {According to the machine, this was the only
move. But who makes such a move, putting yet another pawn on a light square and
weakening g5 $2 It feels like Black's task is impossible, and even here, he is
still suffering after} 28. Qg5 Qxg5 29. hxg5 $14) 28. h5 $1 Qd6 29. Bg4 $1
{White's pieces are springing to life, and he is now winning. The bishop on d3
might look nice and anchored, but it is not doing much, and it is unable to help
Black fight for squares like f5 or e6.} 29... h6 30. Qe3 Qf4 31. Qxf4 (31. Bf5
{This may have been even faster.}) 31... Rxf4 32. Ne6 {In my opinion, Caruana
only made two serious mistakes all game. One was to play c4. But, the second one
was to not resign here. At this point, I really cannot imagine Hikaru ever not
converting this with White. Under other circumstances, I would not criticize
continuing the game; Black is not totally out of practical hope. But in this
particular case, Caruana has a huge game with White against Nepo tomorrow, now a
full point ahead of him. It's about as clear of a must-win scenario as one could
imagine, and it is clearly the most important game of the tournament. Caruana
will have White, and he should definitely get his chances. But having a couple
extra hours to rest and prepare for the Petroff would have been a huge asset,
and in my opinion, a much larger one than hoping for the 1\% chance of Hikaru
not winning this position.} 32... Nxe6 33. Bxe6+ Kh7 34. Bxd5 R8f5 35. Bc6 Rxh5
36. Bd4 Rhf5 37. Nf2 Rf7 38. b4 h5 39. a4 (39. Be8 {This seems rather
convincing. Black loses the h-pawn.} 39... R7f5 {Trying to save it will lead to
a trapped rook.} 40. Be3 $1 Rh4 41. g3) 39... bxa4 40. Bxa4 h4 41. Be3 R4f5 42.
Ra1 {Hikaru made his life a little tougher here and had to find some only moves,
but they were pretty straightforward. He did not take long to find all of them.}
42... h3 43. Ra2 $1 {Luckily for White, there wasn't much choice. This was the
only way to prevent h2+.} (43. gxh3 $2 {This would fall for Black's trap.} 43...
Rf3 $1 44. Re1 Rg3+ $1 {Black is turning the tables.}) 43... hxg2 44. Bd1 $1
{Another good move, stopping Rf3.} 44... R7f6 {Now, last up is not letting Black
defend the pawn with Rg6.} 45. Bg4 $1 Rd5 46. Kxg2 $1 Rg6 47. Kg3 {White has
reached an ideal coordination again with no counterplay, and now the game wins
itself.} 47... Bf1 {Finally that bishop gets to move... but it still isn't doing
anything on f1 and has to come back to d3 the next move anyway.} 48. Bd4 Bd3 49.
Kf4 Kg8 50. Bf5 Rh6 51. Ng4 Rhd6 52. Ne3 Rb5 53. Bc5 Rf6 54. Ke5 Kf7 55. Nd5
{I'm not sure it was necessary to let Black get the pawn to e2, but Hikaru kept
it all under control.} (55. Rf2 $18 {Time to resign.}) 55... Rxf5+ 56. Kxf5 e3+
57. Ke5 e2 58. Bf2 Rb8 59. Be1 Re8+ 60. Kf4 g5+ {Now again, White needed a
couple only moves... but they are not hard.} 61. Kg3 $1 Re6 62. Kf2 Rh6 63. Ke3
Re6+ 64. Kf2 Rh6 65. Ne3 {Of course, White does not repeat a second time.} 65...
Rf6+ 66. Kg3 Rf1 67. Ng2 {White has re-coordinated, and Black's e-pawn is firmly
stopped. The rook can now go and start taking the other ones.} 67... Rf6 68. Bf2
Kg6 69. Ra5 $1 Re6 70. Ne1 $1 Bf5 71. Nf3 Rd6 72. Nd4 Bd3 73. Re5 Kf6 74. Nf3
{Facing the loss of the g5-pawn, Caruana finally resigned. The game lasted over
six hours and finished past 9pm local time. I have to imagine this will not do
him any favors tomorrow. Hikaru's technique was not perfect, and honestly not
even that great, but the win was still never in doubt. I really think resigning
earlier was the best call given the tournament situation.} 1-0
